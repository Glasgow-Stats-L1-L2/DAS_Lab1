# Arranging Multiple Plots On A Page {-}

Often we need to produce plots of different types and display them together. The `grid.arrange()` function in the `gridExtra` package is one way to do this, as shown here in this code using plots that we have seen above:  

```{r gridExtra, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 

library(gridExtra)

p1 <- ggplot(data = Alaska, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) +
  labs(x = "Departure delay (minutes)", y = "Arrival delay (minutes)",
       title = "Alaska Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2013") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=7))

p2 <- ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Temperature (Hourly)",
        title = "Hourly temperatures from NYC in 2013 by month")  +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                              "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))+ 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=7))

p3 <-  ggplot(data = carrier.freq, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = number)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Carrier", y = "Count",
        title = "Carriers who flew out of New York City in 2013") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=7))

p4 <-  ggplot(data = Newark.Jan, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Time (Hours)", y = "Temperature",
        title = "Hourly Temperature at Newark Airport in January 2013") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=7))

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

More examples can be found in this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html).  Another way to do this is using the [`cowplot` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html).
